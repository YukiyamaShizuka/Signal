# Signal Language

**Signal** is a low-level control language written entirely in ARM64 assembly.  
It is designed for deterministic memory handling, explicit execution flow, and structural traceability — forming the foundation runtime for [TreeOS](https://github.com/your-org/treeos).

Signal breaks away from abstraction layers and returns control directly to the system designer.

## Features

- Deterministic grow-live-fall execution model
- Explicit memory and register-level operations
- Pipeline-structured control (e.g., `a → b → c` task relay)
- Built for Apple M3 Max and ARM64 bare-metal contexts
