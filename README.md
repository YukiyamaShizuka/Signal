# Signal: A Deterministic Instruction System

Signal is a custom low-level language written in ARM64 assembly, designed to power transparent execution flows and memory-precise operations.  
It is the instruction core of the TreeOS project — an operating system where logic, data, and process flow are separated, traceable, and controllable.

## Getting Started

To explore the execution model:

```bash
cd src
cat src/loop_pipeline.s
```

## Sponsor This Project

Signal is being developed independently, without institutional support.  
If you believe in open, deterministic, and low-level system design — your support will help the author continue research and development.

### Goal

Help fund a **MacBook Air M4 (24GB RAM / 512GB SSD)**  
This machine will serve as a dedicated development platform for low-level system architecture and execution model design.
