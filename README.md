# Signal Language

**Signal** is a low-level control language written entirely in ARM64 assembly.  
It is designed for deterministic memory handling, explicit execution flow, and structural traceability — forming the foundation runtime for [TreeOS](https://github.com/your-org/treeos).

Signal breaks away from abstraction layers and returns control directly to the system designer.

---

## Features

- Deterministic grow-live-fall execution model
- Explicit memory and register-level operations
- Pipeline-structured control (e.g., `a → b → c` task relay)
- Built for Apple M3 Max and ARM64 bare-metal contexts

## Getting Started

To explore the execution model:

```bash
cd src
cat src/loop_pipeline.s

## Sponsor This Project

Signal is being developed independently, without institutional support.  
If you believe in open, deterministic, and low-level system design — your support will help the author continue research and development.

### Goal

Help fund a **MacBook Air M4 (24GB RAM / 512GB SSD)** as a dedicated development machine for Signal and TreeOS projects.
