# Sponsor the Signal Project

Signal is a low-level language designed from scratch in ARM64 assembly, built to support deterministic system execution and future AI-integrated control layers.  
It is the foundation layer of TreeOS — a new kind of operating system where memory, control, and logic are fully transparent and traceable.

## Why Sponsor?

This project is being developed **entirely by an individual**, without institutional funding or hardware sponsorship.  
To continue development — especially writing and testing full assembly on Apple Silicon — the author hopes to acquire:

**A MacBook Air M4 (24GB RAM / 512GB SSD)**  
This will serve as a dedicated development and test device for low-level code in the Signal/TreeOS environment.
