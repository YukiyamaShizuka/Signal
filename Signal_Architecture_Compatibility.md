# Signal Architecture Compatibility Statement  
*Date: 2025-05-20*

## Overview

Signal is designed from the ground up as an instruction-level structural language. Its execution model is defined by explicit vector and scalar memory lifecycles, mapped directly to the machine's instruction set.

It is not dependent on any specific hardware architecture, platform vendor, or system stack. As long as the target system maintains execution determinism, memory traceability, and stable IO behavior, Signal can be implemented and validated.

## Supported Architectures

Signal is fundamentally platform-agnostic. It can be executed on:

- **x86-64** (Intel/AMD workstations, including server-class CPUs)
- **ARM64** (Apple Silicon, ARMv9+ custom cores)
- **RISC-V** (future roadmap for instruction mapping planned)
- Any architecture with a 64-bit register model and deterministic instruction set

Though early experimentation was conducted on ARM64 (Apple M3 Max), the structural lifecycle model of Signal is equally replicable on x86 platforms.

## Why x86 Is Fully Acceptable

The Signal language runtime does not rely on vendor-specific acceleration, kernel bypass, or architectural privilege instructions. All key constructs—such as:

- Leaf lifecycles (grow → live → fall)
- Vector-based memory paths
- Scalar-bound execution anchors
- Deterministic path collapse and tracing

can be executed and analyzed on any high-performance x86 workstation, provided the hardware is stable and sufficiently provisioned.

Workstations such as:

- **Lenovo ThinkStation P8 / PX**
- **HP Z8 Fury**
- **Dell Precision 7865**

are fully viable as structural development platforms.

## System Requirements (Recommended Baseline)

To ensure full structure-level execution, including integration of TreeOS, SapClarify, and GPT-based behavior overlays, the following hardware is recommended:

- **CPU**: AMD Threadripper PRO 7995WX / Intel Xeon W-3400 series
- **Memory**: 1TB–2TB ECC DDR5 RAM
- **GPU**: RTX 6000 Ada (single or dual card with NVLink, if available)
- **Storage**: 4TB+ Gen4 NVMe SSD, optional RAID redundancy
- **Cooling**: Full air cooling, no liquid systems; workstation-class thermal management
- **Chassis**: Non-gaming tower design, no RGB, minimal noise

---

## Display Requirements

While Signal and TreeOS are computationally efficient, structural analysis involves continuous observation of:

- Execution overlays
- UI path tracing
- Token flow diagrams
- Multi-channel SapClarify feedback layers

A high-resolution, stable, non-distracting visual workspace is critical.

**Preferred display setup:**

- **2× ASUS ProArt 8K Mini LED displays** (e.g. PA32KCX or equivalent)
- HDR1000 or better, calibrated color, matte finish
- No RGB lighting, no curved surfaces, no gaming features

> These displays are not for media—they are for structure visibility.  
> They are instrumentation panels for systems under construction.

---

## Summary

Signal is not about the machine—it’s about the structure.  
As long as the system is stable, deterministic, and traceable, architecture decisions remain flexible.

This project is fully compatible with high-end x86 workstations.  
There is no platform lock-in. There is no dependency on Apple or ARM.

> **Platform independence. Structure first.**  
> And when observing structure: **clarity matters.**
